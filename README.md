# asciidoc2epub
A very simple node script used for converting .asciidoc book into .epub.

# Example
`sudo node index.js input/mybook.asciidoc myname`

The converted result will be placed under `output/nyname.epub`.

`sudo` keyword is required for creating a new file, otherwise a change of writing permissions is required.

# Note 
The script is very simple and basic, if you want feel free to add new features.
